## Load/Unload Mechanism of Cake Baking Robot
This is the code for the Load/Unload mechanism of the Cake Baking Robot that my Robotics Class made for our final project. This mechanism was in charge of loading the cake batter into the oven, taking the completed cake out, delivering it to the frosting mechanism, and then displaying it for viewers.
